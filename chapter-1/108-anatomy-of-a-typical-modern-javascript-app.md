# [译] [108] 解构一个典型的现代 JavaScript 应用

## Anatomy of a Typical Modern JavaScript App

While every app is unique, most share some common concerns, such as hosting infrastructure, resource management, presentation, and UI behaviors. This section covers where these various elements typically live in the application, and the common mechanisms that allow them to communicate.

### Infrastructure

![Infrastructure][9]

Figure&nbsp;1-1.&nbsp;Infrastructure

Infrastructure can come in many flavors, and have lots of different caching mechanisms, but generally, infrastructure consists of (back to front):

  * A data store

  * A Virtual Private Network (VPN) or firewall (to protect the data store from unauthorized access)

  * A black box JSON RESTful Web Service Layer

  * Various third party APIs

  * An app server / Content Management System (CMS) to route requests and deliver pages to the client

  * A static Content Deliver Network (CDN) for cached files (like images, JavaScript, CSS, and client side templates)

  * The client (browser)

The data store is just like a sounds: A place to store your application data. This is commonly a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) with a Structured Query Language (SQL) API, but the popularity of NoSQL solutions is on the rise. In the future it's likely that many applications will use a combination of both.

### JSON: Data Storage and Communication

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open standard developed by Douglas Crockford which specifies a subset of the native JavaScript object literal syntax for use in data representation, communication, and storage.

Prior to the JSON specification, most client-server communications were being delivered in much more verbose XML snippets. JavaScript developers work a lot with JSON web services, and frequently define internal data using JSON syntax.

Take this example message, describing a collection of books:

    [
        {
            “title” : “JavaScript: The Good Parts”,
            “author” : “Douglas Crockford”,
            “ISBN” : “0596517742”
        },
        {
            “title” : “JavaScript Patterns”,
            “author” : “Stoyan Stefanov”,
            “ISBN” : “0596806752”
        }
    ]

As you can see, this format is nearly identical to JavaScript’s object literal syntax, with a couple important differences:

  * All attributes (names and values) must be enclosed in double quotes.

  * JSON records cannot contain circular references.

  * JSON cannot contain functions.

### NoSQL Datastores

Prior to the advent of Extensible Markup Language (XML) and JSON data stores, nearly all web services were backed by RDBMS. An RDBMS stores discrete data points in tables, and groups data output using table lookups in response to SQL queries.

NoSQL data stores, in contrast, store entire records in documents or document snippets, without resorting to table-based structured storage. Document-oriented data stores commonly store data in XML format, while object-oriented data stores commonly employ the JSON format. The latter are particularly well suited to web application development, because JSON is the format you use to communicate natively in JavaScript.

Examples of popular JSON-based NoSQL datastores include [MongoDB][10] and [CouchDB][11]. Despite the recent popularity of NoSQL, it is still very common to find modern JavaScript applications backed by MySQL and similar RDBMS’.

### RESTful JSON Web Services

_Representational State Transfer_ (REST) is a client-server communication architecture that creates a separation of concerns between data resources and user interfaces (or other data resource consumers, such as data analysis tools and aggregators). Services that implement REST are referred to as RESTful. The server manages data resources (such as user records). It does not implement the user interface (look and feel). Clients are free to implement the UI (or not) in whatever manner or language is desired. REST architecture does not address how user interfaces are implemented. It only deals with maintaining application state between the client and the server.

RESTful web services use HTTP verbs to tell the server what action the client intends. The actions supported are:

  * Create a new entry in the resource collection: HTTP POST.

  * Retrieve a resource representation: HTTP GET verb.

  * Update (Replace) the resource: HTTP PUT.

  * Delete a resource: HTTP DELETE.

This might look familiar if you're familiar with CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete). Just remember that in the REST mapping, update really means _replace_.

A typical state transfer flow looks like this:

![REST Sequence][12]

Figure&nbsp;1-2.&nbsp;REST Sequence

  1. Client requests data from the server with an HTTP GET request to the resource _Uniform Resource Indicator_ (URI). Each resource on the server has a unique URI.

  2. The server retrieves the data (typically from a database or cache) and packages it into a convenient representation for the client.

  3. Data is returned in the form of a document. Those documents are commonly text strings containing JSON encoded objects, but REST is agnostic about how you package your data. It's also common to see XML based RESTful services. Most new services default to JSON formatted data, and many support both XML and JSON.

  4. Client manipulates the data representation.

  5. Client makes a call to the same endpoint URI with a PUT, sending back the manipulated data.

  6. The resource data on the server is replaced by the data in the PUT request.

It's common to be confused about whether to use PUT or POST to change a resource. REST eliminates that confusion. With REST, a POST request is always made on a collection to create a new resource.

For example, you might create a new user by hitting `/users/` with a POST request, at which point the server will generate a unique ID you can use to access the new resource at `/users/_`userid`_`. The server will return a new user representation with its own unique URI. You cannot modify an existing resource with POST. Only add children to it.

Use PUT to change the user's display name by hitting `/users/_`userid`_` with the updated user record. Note that this will completely replace the user record, so make sure that the representation you PUT contains everything you want it to contain.

You can learn more about working with REST in the Application Architecture chapter.
