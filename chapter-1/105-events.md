## Events

Inside the browser, everything runs in an event loop. JavaScript coders quickly learn to think in terms of event handlers, and as a result, code from experienced JavaScript developers tends to be well organized and efficient. Operations that might block processing in other languages happen concurrently in JavaScript.

If you click something, you want something to happen instantly. That impatience has led to wonderful advancements in UI design, such as Google Instant, and the ground breaking address lookup on [The Wilderness Downtown][8]. (“The Wilderness Downtown” is an interactive short film by Chris Milk set to the Arcade Fire song, “We Used To Wait”. It was built entirely with the latest open web technologies.) Such functionality is powered by Ajax calls that do their thing in the background without slowing down the UI.
