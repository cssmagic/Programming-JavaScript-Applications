## Client Side Concerns

There are several client-side concerns that almost every mature JavaScript application might deal with at some point:

  * Module management

  * Events

  * Presentation and DOM manipulation

  * Internationalization

  * Data Management and IO (including AJAX)

  * Routing (translating URLs to script actions)

  * Logging

  * Analytics Tracking

  * Authentication

  * Feature Toggling (decouple code deployment and feature release)

Various libraries and frameworks exist which generally attempt to provide some combination of mechanisms to deal with these concerns. Libraries roughly fall into two categories: Minimal and monolithic. Minimal libraries generally provide a handful of objects and methods which make it easier to build well organized applications. Perhaps the most famous example is Backbone.js, which provides Views, Models, Collections, Routers, and Events.

That may sound like a lot, until you compare it to something like the Dojo framework, which is something like a library of libraries. It includes an impressive array of components which do everything from extending JavaScript with ideas from other programming languages like aspects (Aspect Oriented Programming) to DOM widgets such as a calendar. Dojo is interesting because it started out more monolithic, and now it's actually a tiny module loader with a large library of components that you can use if you wish, without loading the entire Dojo framework.

Larger frameworks tend to be more heavy-handed (opinionated) about how your application architecture should function.

There is a growing trend in the JavaScript community moving in the direction of micro libraries, and micro library frameworks. [Microjs.com][5] has a list of interesting micro libraries. You should certainly explore the wealth of microlibraries available in the community, and use the ones that solve your problems.

You might see microlibrary proponents discourage the use of jQuery, not least because it's quite large compared to most microlibraries. However, there is some security in using a well tested library like jQuery because it is used and improved by thousands of other smart developers. It's usually safe to assume that jQuery will mostly behave as expected (of course, there are always exceptions).

Despite the claims of microlibary authors, most microlibraries have not undergone the same level of scrutiny as jQuery, and small libraries don't equate to bug free libraries. Everybody makes mistakes. Be prepared to debug them as you work with them. Please contribute fixes back to the author if you find and fix a bug.

It's also likely that you'll use most of jQuery's core feature set in every application that you build. I see no good reason to reassemble that feature set from microlibraries every time you start a new project.

Also be aware that many microlibraries may need to reinvent the wheel over and over again for commonly needed patterns, like copying attrubites from one object to another (as in jQuery or Underscore's `.extend()` method). It might seem like a good idea to use less code, but there's a chance you'll end up using more, instead, unless you go with a well organized microlibrary framework with components designed to be used together.

In order to decide which application frameworks or libraries might help you build your application, take a look at the [TodoMVC project][6], which compares many commonly used libraries, such as Backbone.js, Angular.js, Dojo, and YUI by showing you an example of what a simple Todo application looks like using each library.

### Module Management

Module management is concerned with supplying a standard architecture that allows your modules to fit together easily and communicate with each other without being tightly coupled.

The module manager prescribes a standard module API that all other modules can implement and a sandbox of common library functionality that any module can use, so that application modules can stay lightweight and focus exclusively on the service that they provide.

Module management typically supplies your application with:

  * Namespacing

  * Sandbox (a base layer of functionality that other modules can safely use)

  * Access to environment variables and bootstrapped data

  * Module lifecycle hooks (help with setup and teardown)

  * An event system for inter-module communication

Nicholas Zakas gave a related talk called [Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture][7], and Addy Osmani (author of Aura) wrote about it in ["Patterns For Large-Scale JavaScript Application Architecture"][8]. Often, module management implementations are part of a monolithic application library tightly coupled to a proprietary codebase, or both.

Aura is a good example of an open-source implementation with a fairly narrow focus on module management - with one clear difference: Aura has a strong focus on widgets, which are modules that have a UI component that needs to render itself to the screen. A generic module could perform any type of service, and may or may not need a dedicated space to render. A widget exists primarily for the purpose of suppling UI output or UI interaction.

For the sake of clarity and simplicity in the following examples, I wrote a simple module management solution called Tinyapp. It is an open source library. To get the source, clone it from Github:

    $ git clone git://github.com/dilvie/tinyapp.git

#### Getting Started

As of this writing, Tinyapp is rapidly evolving. Please see the [Tinyapp website][9] to learn how to download and install the latest version.

Simply `require()` it and initialize your app:

    var app = require('tinyapp');

    app.init({
      environment: environment,
      pageData: pageData,
      beforeRender: [promise1, promise2...]
    });

The `environment` object (optional) is the primary means of passing application environment configuration into your JavaScript application. Use it for passing in data that usually has to come from server side configuration, such as environment domain names, application ids for third party services, CDN urls, etc...

There are a couple of ways you could source the environment from the server side: load it with Ajax, or include it in the html with an inline script.

The `pageData` object is intended to register bootstrapped data with the app at page load time.

`beforeRender` is a list of promises which all must finish before the render phase begins. For example, many apps will need i18n translations to load before any module is allowed to render. By adding an i18n promise to the application's `beforeRender` queue, you can postpone render until the translations are loaded. Using `beforeRender` can prevent tricky race condition bugs, and provide a neat solution if you need a guaranteed way to handle tasks before the modules render. See [“Registration, Loading and Rendering”][10] for more about application and module timing hooks.

Be careful with the global `beforeRender` queue. Each item you add to it compounds the possibility that something in the queue will fail, which might significantly delay or block the render of your application. If what you're waiting for only impacts a single module, keep the waiting logic isolated to that module.

Here's how you might build up a typical Tinyapp module:

Require Tinyapp:

    var app = require('tinyapp');

Provide an API:

    var app = require('tinyapp'),

      hello = function hello() {
        return 'hello, world';
      },

      api = {
        hello: hello
      };

Export your module:

    var app = require('tinyapp'),

      hello = function hello() {
        return 'hello, world';
      },

      api = {
        hello: hello
      };

    module.exports = api;

This contrived example should be really be simplified even further. Since it doesn't actually use `tinyapp`, it doesn't need to require it, and since it's only exporting a single fuction (which is actually a pretty good idea for lots of modules), it could just be `module.exports = function hello() { `...

Any standard node-style module could be used as a Tinyapp module, but as you'll see, Tinyapp provides some utility and benefit that you'll use a lot.

#### Registration, Loading and Rendering

If you need to fetch some data asynchronously before you render your module, Tinyapp helps speed things up by launching your asynchronous calls as early as possible.

Module initialization is broken into two phases: load and render. Imagine you want to asynchronously fetch some data while the page is still loading so that you can begin to render it as early as possible. This can speed up your perceived page load times.

The solution is to kick off the asynchronous fetch at load time, so that it begins the download as early as possible: before DOM ready, and before the page is done processing all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the page. Since the load is asynchronous, it will introduce only a few milliseconds of latency during the load phase, but it'll do most of the work in the background while the browser continues processing the rest of the page in parallel with the load.

If you have data that is secondary to the main purpose of the page, and you can get away with waiting until after the DOM is ready, it's a good idea to let your page load normally and fetch the data during the render step, instead of using the early load hook. This will reduce the number of page requests that must be handled at page load time (eliminating the latency hit) and hopefully also improve the perceived performance of your app.

Tinyapp allows you to hook into those page load phases individually so you can optimize page load times and manage render dependencies without worrying about asynchronous timing issues.

You can specify `load()` and `render()` callbacks by passing them into a registration method:

    app.register({
      load: load,
      render: render
    });

The `render()` callback is called after:

  * Any promise returned by `load()` is resolved. For example, if you return a jQuery AJAX promise from your `load()` function, it will wait until the AJAX fetch is complete. All jQuery AJAX calls return compatible promises.

  * All `beforeRender` callbacks have fired (see [“Getting Started”][11]).

  * The DOM is ready to be manipulated.

Registration is optional. If you don't need any of the features it provides, you aren't required to use it.

Time for an example. Imagine you have a widget that displays tour dates for bands. Here's how it could work:

    var
      app = require('tinyapp'),
      view = require('./view'),
      data,

      load = function load() {
        var url = 'http://api.bandsintown.com/artists/' %2B
          'Skrillex.json?api_version=2.0&amp;app_id=YOUR_APP_ID';

        whenLoaded = app.get(url);
        whenLoaded.done(function (response) {
          data = response;
        });

        return whenLoaded.promise();
      },

      render = function render() {
        view.render(data);
      };

    app.register({
      load: load,
      render: render,
    });

    module.exports = api;

Try not to do anything blocking in your `load()` function. For example, you might want to fetch the data that you need to complete your page render, but if you're loading a large collection and you need to iterate over the collection and do some data processing, save the data processing step for `render()` time, when you're not blocking the page render process.

_It's not safe to manipulate the DOM at all in your `load()` function._

### Events

_Events_ are a method of communicating between different application modules or components in order to achieve loose coupling, asynchronous communication, interprocess communication, or any combination of the above. For example, the browser environment is event-driven. It presents DOM elements to users (buttons and form inputs, for example), and then responds to user input by firing events for the application to listen for and handle.

You're probably already familiar with responding to existing browser DOM events. If you need a refresher, consult the [Mozilla DOM Reference][12] or "Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference" by Danny Goodman (O’Reilly). This section covers defining and using your own custom events, independent of the DOM.

In order to keep modules decoupled from each other, it's helpful to think of events as reports of what has happened, rather than commands for what should happen next. Other modules can listen for the events they care about and decide what to do next on their own.

#### Event Emitters

Often we need to provide a method API that can handle a range of asynchronous communication. A good solution to this problem is to return an object that emits events. DOM elements are event emitters, so that they can notify you of user input or other state changes. For example, most elements emit a click `event` when the user clicks on them, and the HTML5 video API emits events for loading progress, playback position changes, and a variety of other information that isn't immediately known.

It's possible to create your own event emitter API that you can mix into any JavaScript object. A minimal implementation might only have three methods:

.on(), .trigger(), .off()

Backbone.js is a client side MV* library that provides event emitters for models, views, routers, and collections. If you're using Backbone, (which relies on Underscore), you can turn any object into an event emitter like this:

    _.extend(myObject, Backbone.Events);

    myObject.on('my_event', function handle(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });

    object.trigger('my_event', 'hi'); // logs 'hi'

The downside to triggering events only on the object to which the events belong is that every listener must be given a reference to the object. In situations where there are potentially many objects listening, that strategy requires too much boilerplate code to be maintainable.

Another problem you might encounter is that listeners must be tightly coupled to emitters, which partially defeats the purpose of using events in the first place. To get around that, you can wire up emitters and receivers through an event mediator, or connector.

In cases where you have a views with child views that need to communicate up to the top level, this pattern becomes problematic because at each level, the child and parent must register with each other to relay messages back and forth. In that situation, you create a lot of code overhead, and debugging event passing bugs can become very painful.

If you have an object that needs to inform your application about asynchronous events such as incoming push notifications (chat notifications, new items added to collections, etc...), an event emitter might be the right solution.

#### Event Aggregators

In contrast to event emitters, an _event aggregator_ is a central object that collects events from multiple sources, and delivers them to registered subscribers. This is essentially a type of publish/subscribe pattern. An aggregator eliminates the need for specialized mediators to keep an emitter and listener decoupled. Again, with backb and Underscore, that might look something like this:

    var app = {
      bus: _.extend({}, Backbone.Events)};

    app.bus.on('my_event', function handle(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });

    app.bus.trigger('my_event', 'hi'); // logs 'hi'

Event aggregators can be enormously useful. Because neither emitter nor subscriber need know about the other, aggregators enable very loose coupling between modules. Each only needs a reference to the aggregator.

#### Queues and Stacks

One disadvantage of the publish/subscribe pattern is that there is no guarantee that a message will be processed once it is broadcast.

A _message queue_ is a type of event mediator that records every message it hears in a queue (or stack) for later processing. That log of messages can be permanently recorded, if needed, and the queue is actively managed, so it's possible to enforce guarantees that some listener got the message.

Often there is a need for separate modules or processes to collaborate in order to process input. For example, imagine that your application is a tool for photographers. It allows photographers to upload a photo, resize it, watermark it, and then send it to various social networks automatically.

When a photo is uploaded, it's added to a processing queue. Later, a pool of photo processing workers can independently pull photo processing jobs from the message queue as they are ready to process them, and message back when the photos are ready to be distributed across the web. Other workers can then pick up the finished photo messages and handle the distribution step. With this architecture, the processing workers can scale independently of the distribution workers.

If you need a message queue, you might be in luck. It's such a common pattern that there are several popular out of the box solutions, such as [Kestrel][13], or [Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)][14].

#### Choosing the Right Event Model

In reality, no single event model provides a complete solution to event management. It doesn't make sense to examine a bunch of different event models and chose just one for your application. Most web-based applications eventually need more than one type. Here are some example use cases:

For reusable libraries that deal with asynchronous behaviors, consider an event emitter.

For communication between models, views, logging systems, analytics systems, and so on, where it's advantageous to keep coupling to a minimum, go with an event aggregator.

For reliable communication between independently scalable and deployable application tiers, a message queue may be the right solution.

This guide has really only skimmed the surface of possible messaging patterns. I've intentionally focused only on the most common patterns that might be handy in almost every app that grows beyond a few thousand lines of code. For more ideas, take a look at Martin Fowler's writing on [Event Aggregator][15], [Observer Synchronization][16], and [Event Sourcing][17].

#### Events by Example

To better understand how the most common messaging patterns fit together, it might be useful to revisit the guestlist app introduced in [Chapter&nbsp;5][18].

Of course, the whole idea here is to keep the presentation concerns separate from the data management and domain logic concerns. Backbone.js can give you a leg up with that by encapsulating common data management tasks in models and collections, and encapsulating display and UI concerns in views.

All `Backbone.Model` instances are event emitters. When a model attribute changes, it emits a `change:` event, where `` is the name of the attribute that changed. Since you want to communicate the change to the view without tightly coupling the model to the view or vice verse, you'll want to have the model listen for its own change event, and rebroadcast it it the app level.

The view can listen for the app level `changed` event and respond by updating the list item that changed.

Here is the new guestlist model. You can listen to the `Backbone.Model` event emitter with, `this.on('change:checkedIn', handler)`:

Example&nbsp;6-1.&nbsp;guestmodel.js

    var Model = require('backbone-browserify').Model,
      app = require('./tinyapp'),

      // Set the checkedIn attribute on the model.

      toggleCheckedIn = function toggleCheckedIn() {
        this.set('checkedIn', !this.get('checkedIn'));
      },

      delegate = function delegate() {
        var sourceId = this.get('id');

        // Listen for toggled event, sent from the view.
        // sourceId is used to filter the event. The model
        // does not need to know where the event comes from --
        // only which item was clicked.

        app.on('toggled-checkedin', sourceId,
          toggleCheckedIn.bind(this));

        // Relay the change event so the view can listen for it
        // without knowing anything about the model.

        this.on('change:checkedIn', function (item) {

          // Send a shallow copy of the list item as the
          // message payload. Make sure the new checkedIn
          // state is easy to access.

          var event = app.extend({}, item, {
            sourceId: this.id,
            checkedIn: item.get('checkedIn')
          });

          // Broadcast the message on the aggregator.

          app.trigger('changed.checkedIn', event);
        }.bind(this));
      },

      // The collection expects a Backbone.Model constructor.

      api = Model.extend({
        initialize: delegate,
        toggleCheckedIn: toggleCheckedIn
      });

    module.exports = api;

Note the line:

    app.on('toggled-checkedin', sourceId,
      toggleCheckedIn.bind(this));

Tinyapp adds the concept of a `sourceId` to event listening. The idea is that you augment your triggered event object with the id of the object you're talking about. When you listen for the event (like this example illustrates), you can pass in the object's ID to filter out any events that don't have that `sourceId` on the event object. This can be handled at the application framework or event library level. For example, in Tinyapp, there's a wrapper around the `events.on` method that looks something like this:

    function on() {
      var args = [].slice.call(arguments),
        type = args[0],
        sourceId = args[1],
        callback = args[2];

      // If there's no sourceId, just pass this through
      // to the event emitter.

      if (args.length XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX= 2) {
        events.on.apply(events, arguments);
      } else {

        // Otherwise, filter out any events that don't match
        // the expected sourceId.

        events.on.call(events, type, function (event) {
          if (event.sourceId === sourceId) {
            callback(event);
          }
        });
      }
    }

Similar strategies include namespacing events, and creating separate channels (aggregators) for separate concerns.

Regardless of which mechanism you prefer for event communication, be careful not to refer to other modules directly (including via channels and namespaces). If modules know how to communicate with each other directly, it defeats the purpose of loose coupling, and you might as well give them a direct handle on each other. A common pitfall that I have fallen into myself is to use the module's namespace as the event namespace. Doing so gives every module that needs to listen knowledge of the emitting module by name.

Returning to the example app: The collection isn't doing much yet, but later you'll use it to add and remove guests. For now, it just gets a handle to the model constructor which it will use to instantiate new list items. The create method is just a thin wrapper around collection instantiation.

Example&nbsp;6-2.&nbsp;guestlistcollection.js

    var app = require('./tinyapp'),
      Model = require('./guestmodel'),
      Collection = require('backbone-browserify')
        .Collection.extend({
          model: Model
        }),

      create = function create(models) {
        models = models || app.pageData.guestList;

        return new Collection(models);
      },

      api = {
        create: create
      };

    module.exports = api;

Similar to how the model relays its own events, the view listens for DOM events and relays them on the app event aggregator so that other modules can listen (such as models or click loggers). Pay special attention to the `delegate()` and `relayClick()` functions:

Example&nbsp;6-3.&nbsp;guestlistview.js

    var app = require('./tinyapp'),

      // Assign Backbone.View to the View var.

      View = require('backbone-browserify').View,

      $ = app.$,
      checkedinClass = 'icon-check',
      listClass = 'dropdown-menu',
      guestClass = 'guest',

      // Rebroadcast DOM click events on the app event
      // aggregator.

      relayClick = function relayClick(e) {

        // Get the ID from the element and use it to
        // namespace the event.

        var sourceId = $(this).attr('id'),
          event = app.extend(e, {
            sourceId: $(this).attr('id')
          });

        app.trigger('toggled-checkedin', event);
      },

      delegate = function delegate() {

        // Delegate all click events to the parent element.

        this.$el.on('click', '.' %2B guestClass, relayClick);

        // Listen for changed events from the model
        // and make sure the element reflects the current
        // state.

        app.on('changed.checkedIn', function changeHandler(event) {
          var id = event.id;

          // Select the right list item by id.

          this.$el.find('http://www.cssmagic.net#' %2B id)
            .toggleClass(checkedinClass, event.checkedIn);

        }.bind(this));
      },

      render = function render(guestlist) {
        var $el = this.$el;

        $el.empty();

        // Loop over the passed-in guest models and render
        // them as li elements.

        guestlist.forEach(function (guestModel) {
          var $guest;
          guest = guestModel.toJSON();
          $guest = $('' %2B
            '' %2B guest.name %2B
            '');
          $guest.appendTo($el);
        });

        return this;
      },

      // Define the backbone view.
      GuestlistView = View.extend({
        tagName: 'ol',
        id: 'guestlist-view',
        className: listClass,
        initialize: delegate,
        render: render
      }),

      // Expose a factory function.
      create = function create() {
        return new GuestlistView();
      },

      api = {
        create: create
      };

    module.exports = api;

### MVC / MV*

_MVC_ (Model, View, Controller) is an architecture for managing separation of presentation logic from business domain logic in applications.

_Model_ refers to application state, and methods for manipulating and retrieving state. Usually there is a mechanism to notify observing views when the model state changes. There can be more than one view listening to a single model.

_View_ refers to the UI that gets drawn to the screen. It generally listens to the model so that it can update the UI when state changes, and sometimes to the controller so that it can handle presentation changes that do not impact the business domain (such as scrolling or showing / hiding UI).

_Controller_ refers to the user interaction logic. It updates the model in response to user requests. In some MVC interpretations, it is responsible for instantiating both the model and the view, and wiring up event listeners between them. Most server side web frameworks have controllers that route incoming requests to actions, which manipulate the model and serve updated views to the user.

![MVC][19]

Figure&nbsp;6-1.&nbsp;MVC

In the browser, where each element in the DOM also happens to be an event emitter, it might seem natural to handle a bit more of the input directly in the view (rather than the controller, as is common with MVC). Several alternatives to MVC have sprung up which deviate slightly from the MVC architecture. The alternatives are commonly grouped together and referred to as _MV*_. Typically there will be a notion of a model and a view (or something like them), and some other notions about how models and views interact.

The most popular MV* library is _Backbone_. Instead of models, views, and controllers, and an opinionated way of stitching them together, Backbone defines `View`, `Model`, `Collection`, and `Router` constructors. You are expected to subclass those constructors using the `.extend()` method available on each of the constructors.

Backbone's `.extend()` method creates classical style inheritance hierarchies, with all the pitfalls that go along with them. I have seen a couple of projects get into trouble by relying too much on Backbone's `.extend()` inheritance. Be careful about subclassing from subclasses. Instead, try passing exemplar prototypes and mixins into `.extend()` in order to facilitate code reuse. See [“Classical Inheritance is Obsolete”][20] and [“Prototypes”][21].

Backbone is not terribly opinionated about how you stitch the various pieces together, but most samples you'll find in the wild give a lot of responsibility to the view, which typically instantiates and keeps a reference to collections, models, or both. A typical arrangement might look something like this:

![Backbone][22]

Figure&nbsp;6-2.&nbsp;Backbone

`Backbone.Router` allows you to update the location bar when the user selects different views, or create actions that get triggered in response to the user navigating to a given URL. This is the primary responsibility of controllers on the server side, because URLs are generally the only way for the user to communicate with a server-side application. That's not the case in a client-side application.

`Backbone.View` is responsible for encapsulating view logic, such as how and when to display information. Views typically listen for DOM events, translate them into some intended action, and then emit events that other modules can subscribe to.

It's common to see views directly update models, collections, and routers, but when they do, it is a slippery slope. Often, developers get confused and start to put too much business logic in the view, which breaks the separation of concerns, and leads to code duplication and hard to find bugs across multiple views which need to share the same business rules. Instead, views should only manage the presentation concerns, and trigger events that other modules can listen for.

`Backbone.Model` is responsible for encapsulating state and business logic. When state changes, it emits events that views can subscribe to.

`Backbone.Collection` is an extremely useful abstraction that provides a managed way of dealing with collections of models, complete with Underscore's many functional methods, which you can use to query, filter, and sort your collections.

As you've already seen in the event examples, there are alternative ways to stitch Backbone's tools together. For example, for a an almost entirely decoupled implementation, you can route most of the communication through an event aggregator. That might look something like this:

![Backbone With Event Aggregator][23]

Figure&nbsp;6-3.&nbsp;Backbone With Event Aggregator

The solid lines represent direct references. Dashed lines represent event listeners. As you can see, with this setup, you don't need a lot of direct references, which allows your modules to be a lot less coupled. Views listen for state changes and view selection events, and emits user action events. The Router listens for user route selections, and emits route change events. Collections listen for add and remove events, and relay change events from the model. The model listens for UI input changes and emits change events.

This is the pattern you'll see developing in the examples, but it's certainly not the only way to handle separation of concerns in the browser.

There are many other MV* alternatives, including MVP, MVVM, RVP, etc... I'll leave it to you and Google to work out how all of them differ. The important thing to understand is that all of them exist to allow the separation of presentation logic and business domain logic. In short, your business logic should not be mixed in with your presentation logic and vice verse. You can explore various libraries frameworks at [TodoMVC.com][24].

### Presentation and DOM Manipulation

The primary purpose of a view in Backbone is to present the application's interface to the user and react to user input. As such, every Backbone view should be associated with some DOM. Backbone handles that association with the `.el` and `.$el` properties. The `.el` property is a direct reference to the view's root element, while `.$el` is a cached jQuery or Zepto object for the view's element.

Consider the following from `guestlistview.js`:

Example&nbsp;6-4.&nbsp;Creating a Backbone View

    // Define the backbone view.
    GuestlistView = View.extend({
      tagName: 'ol',
      id: 'guestlist-view',
      className: listClass,
      initialize: delegate,
      render: render
    }),

If specified, Backbone.View will construct `this.el` using the `tagName`, `className`, `id`, and `attributes` parameters. If you don't specify a `tagName`, it will create a `div`. You can also attach the view to an existing element by passing in a value for `.el`.

#### View Events

Backbone lets you pass in an events hash to declaratively specify event handlers. The hash takes the form, `{ 'eventName selector': 'callback' }`. If `'callback'` is a string, it will map to the method on the view object that matches the name. You can also pass an inline function or function reference. Backbone uses jQuery's `.on()` method, and delegates events to the view's root element (`this.el`) by default. If you omit the selector, the root element will be the target element.

Leaving off the selector is probably a code smell. Could you be delegating events to a parent element, instead?

##### Event Delegation

_Event delegation_ is the process of aggregating events from multiple sources to a single event handling mechanism. It's common to encounter large collections which share the same event handlers, but attach different listeners for each item in the collection.

For example, it might have been tempting to implement the guest list item as a separate view, and then rerender the guest template every time the status changed. That might look something like this:

    render = function render(data) {
      var $el = this.$el;

      // Prevent memory leaks in rerender cases.
      $el.off('click.' %2B this.className);
      $el.empty();

      processTemplate($el, data);

      // Reattach listener.
      $el.on('click.' %2B this.className, handleClick);

      return this;
    };

Note that this is essentially equivalent to passing an `events` hash to Backbone in the hypothetical guests `View.extend()`:

    events: {
      'click': handleClick
    }

Note that Backbone automatically delegates using jQuery's `.on()` method, however, passing a hash like this into an item-level view negates that capability. Instead, it will wire up a separate click handler for each list item.

This approach slows down the application in two ways: First, it takes longer to initialize, because of the extra wiring that must be performed for each event handler, for each item. It also consumes more memory, particularly if you chose the inline method to specify the event handler. If you do that, there will actually be a separate copy of the event handler function for each item.

You should be aware that you can leak memory if you bind event handlers to each item in a dynamic collection. For example, if you have a collection which utilizes the infinite scroll technique, you'll need to remove elements from the DOM as they scroll out of view to prevent browser performance issues or crashes. You must remember to remove the event listeners when you remove the items from the DOM. Backbone views have a `.remove()` method which will remove both the DOM listeners, and stop the view from listening for events from other objects.

You've already seen event delegation employed in the `guestlistview.js` `delegate()` function. Now you'll use the built in `Backbone.View` events hash to handle it, instead. Here's what the delegation looked like before:

    // From the delegate() function:
    // Delegate all click events to the parent element.
    this.$el.on('click', '.' %2B guestClass, relayClick);

You'll pull that code out of the delegate() function, and let Backbone handle it for you:

    // Define the backbone view.
    GuestlistView = View.extend({
      tagName: 'ol',
      id: 'guestlist-view',
      className: listClass,
      initialize: delegate,
      render: render,

      // Add the handler to the view object:
      relayClick: relayClick,

      // Let Backbone handle the event delegation:
      events: {
        'click .guest': 'relayClick'
      }
    }),

By delegating the `click` to the parent element, instead of to each list item, only one listener has to be attached per behavior, rather than one per behavior for each item in the list. What's more, you don't have to worry about removing the listener and adding it again if you need to render a list item again. In short, less code to write, and less risk of memory leaks.

Bonus: When you expose your event handlers on the view object, it makes them easier to unit test, because you don't have to figure out how to simulate the events in order to invoke the handlers. Keep in mind that events are a part of the API surface area, and event handlers should be tested, just like public methods.

If you implement list items as sub views, you still need to remember to call the item's `.remove()` method as the item scrolls away, because you still need to stop the view from listening to Backbone events. If you wire up any other kind of event listener (such as an app-level event aggregator), you should remember to remove those listeners, as well.

#### Templates

Templates help to separate display structure concerns from logic. Templates define the structure of your UI, along with some indication of where data should be injected. Templates can be reused with a variety of different data. A template processor combines data and templates to produce the DOM output that will be rendered to the screen.

It's common for template languages to support limited logic, such as if / else statements. I recommend that you avoid the temptation to use any of them, because they defeat the purpose of separating DOM structure from logic concerns -- instead, your logic just lives somewhere else. Even worse, your logic lives in two places, and it's even harder to find the source of bugs.

There are lots of different options for template rendering. Some common choices include Jade, Mustache, Haml, EJS, Plates and Pure. Plates (a Flatiron library) and Pure provide the ability to write templates in pure HTML, with no specialized DSL mixed in at all. Data gets associated via css-style selectors in the JavaScript view layer. Backbone relies on the Underscore library, which happens to include a simple template engine. For the sake of simplicity and familiarity, you'll see it used in the examples.

Let's revisit the guestlist view and replace the inline HTML with a template.

Before:

    '' %2B
      '' %2B guest.name %2B
      ''

After:

    
      
    

Even better, now that it isn't expressed in a JavaScript string, it's obvious that it doesn't belong in the JavaScript view layer at all. For a template this small, it wouldn't do any harm to simply embed it in the HTML for the page. You can do that using a script tag:

    
      
        
      
    

Unless the templates are tiny (a few lines), most templates should be in dedicated files. You may want to group them with corresponding views in the directory hierarchy. You can use a build step to pull templates into your HTML, or for templates that are only used rarely, fetch them as needed via AJAX.

If you're using a module system that doesn't pollute the global namespace, you'll need to explicitly require Underscore in order to access the template utility. If you're just including Backbone stand-alone, you don't need to do anything special to use Underscore's methods. Just use `_.template()` directly. In this case, Browserify will not leak dependencies into the global namespace, so you'll need to require it. In `guestlistview.js`, you'll insert the `require()` line like this:

    // Assign Backbone.View to the View var.
    View = require('backbone-browserify').View,

    // Grab the template utility from Underscore.
    template = require('underscore').template,

Of course, this isn't going to work until we add Underscore to `package.json`:

    "underscore": "*",

Save the file, and run:

    $ npm install

Now that the dependency is there, it's time to add the template code. Underscore lets you compile your HTML templates into an executable function in order to speed up template processing. You can do that near the top of the `render()` function so that it doesn't need to be called for every guest that gets rendered:

Example&nbsp;6-5.&nbsp;render() with Template

    render = function render(guestlist) {
      var $el = this.$el,

        // Compile the guest template.
        guestTemplate = template($('http://www.cssmagic.net#guestTemplate').html());

      $el.empty();

      // Loop over the passed-in guest models and render
      // them as li elements.
      guestlist.forEach(function (guestModel) {
        var guest;

        // Build the data object to pass into the template.
        guest = guestModel.toJSON();

        // Add the guestClass to the data object.
        guest.guestClass = guestClass;

        // Process the template data and append the output to the
        // list element.
        $el.append(guestTemplate(guest));
      });

      return this;
    }

Remember to run `grunt` to rebuild the project files, or set up a `grunt watch` task to build on file save. The tests should pass again. Having the lint and unit test tasks set up makes it easy to refactor like this with confidence, because you'll catch any mistakes early.

#### Web Components

_Web Components_ are a new standard way of creating reusable components and widgets with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The new standards currently lack widespread browser support, but may soon transform the way we write reusable components for JavaScript applications.

Shadow DOM %2B Custom elements = Web Components.

Web Components use a technology called _Shadow DOM_, which allows you to hide an entirely new document context, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Shadow DOM is completely encapsulated from the main document. It gets its own document root (called _shadow root_), and its own execution context for JavaScript. Shadow DOM is also minimally affected by the CSS on the parent page. The DOM encapsulation features should feel familiar to anyone who has used iframes for encapsulation purposes.

Your shadow DOM can be made up of many other HTML elements, but they won't be visible in the DOM tree unless you specifically enable shadow DOM viewing in a debugger, such as Chrome Developer Tools.

_Custom tags_ are an important aspect of web components which allow you to simplify your DOM and write more semantic HTML. For example, if you need to create a knob widget, you can create a component called ``, which reads a lot better than ``. Custom tags can use prototypal inheritance to inherit the properties of other tags. You can simplify the creation of `` by sharing the prototype from ``, and setting some default properties (for example, by selecting `type="range"`). Use the new DOM method, `document.register()` to define the element.

Here's how you might define `` using the `document.register()` polyfill from Mozilla Web Components:

Example&nbsp;6-6.&nbsp;document.register()

    document.register('x-knob', {

      'prototype': Object.create( (window.HTMLInputElement ||
        window.HTMLSpanElement || window.HTMLElement).prototype ),

      'lifecycle': {

        created: function(proto) {
          this.type='range';
          console.log('x-knob created', this);
        },

        inserted: function() {
          console.log('x-knob inserted', this);
        },

        removed: function() {
          console.log('x-knob removed', this);
        },

        attributeChanged: function(attr, value) {
          console.log('x-knob attributeChanged', this, attr, value);
        }

      }
    });

Now that you have a definition, you can instantiate it with:

    var knob = document.createElement('x-knob');

Take a closer look at what happens:

Example&nbsp;6-7.&nbsp;Custom Tag Tests

    $(function () {

      test('document.register()', function () {

        equal(typeof document.register, 'function',
          'Should exist.');

      });

      test('document.createElement("x-knob")', function () {
        var knob = document.createElement('x-knob');

        ok(knob.getAttribute,
          'should produce a custom element.');
      });

      test('x-knob inheritance', function () {
        var knob = document.createElement('x-knob');

        ok(knob.checkValidity,
          'should inherit from input element.');
      });

      test('x-knob input type', function () {
        var knob = document.createElement('x-knob');

        equal(knob.type, 'range',
          'should have type="range".');
      });

    });

As exciting as all this is, it's still bleeding edge. There is currently disagreement in the community about this mechanism, arguing that if we go down this road, we'll lose a lot of the semantic meaning that the community has pushed so hard for. Ian Hickson argues along these lines:

Wouldn't it be better to add a new attribute so that we can preserve the semantics of existing elements? For example: ``. An obvious counter argument is that popular tags will become part of the semantic vernacular, and that agents will begin to recognize them, just as they recognize the semantics of many metadata formats, and many semantic extensions built on top of vanilla HTML. Another counter argument is that many custom elements will not have meaningful base elements whose semantics would be useful to build on.

As of this writing, none of these features are available for production use if you want solid cross-browser support. Mozilla has created a [custom tag polyfill][25] that you can experiment with today for non-production use. There is a small movement to create a library of GUI components using the current state of the web components specification and the Mozilla Web Components polyfill.
