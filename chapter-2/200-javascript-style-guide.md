# [译] [PJA] [200] 第二章 JavaScript 代码风格指南

# Chapter 2. JavaScript Style Guide

You don't need to know the arcane inner workings of JavaScript in order to do lots of useful things with it. However, if you plan to write an application with tens of thousands of lines of code, you're going to need to explore a little deeper. In this chapter, we'll cover some fundamentals that will help you build large apps that are still maintainable. For more on these subjects, I strongly recommend "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford, "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" by David Flanagan, and "JavaScript Patterns".
